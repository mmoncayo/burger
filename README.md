## Description
​This Node app serves as a burger logger where the user can select from a list of burgers to click on to devour or input a custom burger that can then be added to be devoured. This Node app is built using Express and uses MySQL as a database and Handlebars to server the HTML. This app is also deployed on Heroku [here.](https://aqueous-forest-98399.herokuapp.com/)
